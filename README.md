# Airplane Delay Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to predict flight delays due to weather conditions for domestic flights in the United States. Using historical flight data, we create a machine learning model that can predict delays, thereby improving customer experience by providing timely information during the booking process.

## Business Scenario
As part of a travel booking website team, goal is to enhance customer satisfaction by accurately predicting potential weather-related flight delays. This feature assists customers in making informed decisions when booking flights to or from the busiest US airports.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large US air carriers from 2014 to 2018. It includes details such as dates, times, origin, destination, airline, distance, and delay status. The data is distributed across 60 ZIP files, each representing one month's worth of flight data over five years.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook or an environment to run `.ipynb` files.

### Execution
This code can be executed without any errors just by cloing the repo or downloading the .ipynb file and saving in the folder where the data files are.
